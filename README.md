# Survey / Feedback Form

This simple survey form lets users submit their feedback directly in the browser.  
I built this to practice form elements and basic JavaScript event handling.

### Features:
- Collects name, rating, and message
- Shows a thank you message after submission

### Lessons:
I learned about handling form submissions, preventing default behavior, and updating the UI dynamically.

I plan to expand this by connecting it with back-end services in the future.
